# Purpose
This program detects duplicated pictures by using a neural code from a deep network

# Research about image retrieval
Recently, outputs from a layer in a deep network are studied and those outputs, neural code, were found to be a good representaion of pictures.
[1] studied neural code of googlenet and oxfordnet. In short, [1] utilized outputs from a convolutional layer and applyed intra-VLAD [2].

# How to use

    ipython
    run download_model.py googlenet  
    run ddp.py directory1 directory2 directory3  

You can give some directories that contain pictures.  
Neural code of each pictures is stored into feature. feature is dictionary type, thus you can check neural code like this:

    feature["directory1/a.jpg"]

There is a method to search near pictures. I search for near pictures of directory1/a.jpg:

    searchNearPic("directory1/a.jpg", 0.5, feature)

Second argument is threshold of cosine distance.
